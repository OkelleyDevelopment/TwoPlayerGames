    "Cycles are a simple graph with a known competitive coloring number. Both even and odd cycles have competitive coloring numbers of 3. We know that it is impossible for a cycle (of order > 2) to have a competitive coloring number of 2. Take, for example, a cycle of order 3. Each node has two neighbors, so coloring node 0 with color 1 means that nodes 1 and 2 need colors other than 1, but they cannot share the same color as they are connected. Thus at least three colors are required."
